At work, stress is the biggest disruption in productivity. Especially in office employees who are always in front of the computer. Relaxing conditions are needed before doing work to focus on work. In addition, even overwork can make stress explode. A tool is needed that can reduce stress at work so that the productivity of workers increases. My idea is to use a webcam to do stress recognition to the face using deep learning. Then when high stress is detected. The user's computer will ask the user to stop working. Meanwhile, the user's chair will do an electric massage and emit the aroma of aromatherapy so that the user feels more relaxed.
